# Stephen's Tools v3.0

A comprehensive toolkit for audio transcription, OCR, PDF generation, and AI-powered chat. This project allows you to download audio from YouTube and SoundCloud, transcribe it using Whisper, perform OCR on images, combine images into PDFs, and have interactive chat sessions with AI models (OpenAI, LM Studio, or Ollama).

✅ Auto-detects `ffmpeg` from system PATH or common installation locations (Homebrew, apt, Windows local).

## 🎧 FFmpeg Setup

This project requires FFmpeg to extract audio from YouTube and SoundCloud.

### ✅ Auto-Detection

The application automatically detects `ffmpeg` from:
- System PATH
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg` (macOS Homebrew)
- `/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg` (macOS/Linux)
- `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` (Linux)
- `./ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe` (Windows local)

### Installation

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Ubuntu/Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

**Windows:**
1. Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Extract and place `ffmpeg.exe` in `./ffmpeg/bin/` folder, or add to system PATH

---

## 🤖 Local LLM Support (Optional)

You can run the chat feature locally using **Ollama** or **LM Studio**.

### Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama from https://ollama.com
ollama pull llama3
# Start Ollama; it will serve models locally automatically
```

### LM Studio

- Download from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- Download a compatible model (e.g., LLaMA 3 or Mistral)
- Start the LM Studio server before running this project

## ⚡️ GPU Support (NVIDIA CUDA)

- If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to use CUDA acceleration for Whisper and PyTorch:
    1. Install the correct CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch. Visit [PyTorch Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and use the command for your CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 12.1).
    2. Example for CUDA 12.1:
        ```
        pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
        ```
    3. If you only install `torch` with `pip install torch`, you may get the CPU-only version and CUDA will not work.
    4. After installing, test with:
        ```python
        import torch
        print(torch.cuda.is_available())
        print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
        ```
    5. If you see `True` and your GPU name, CUDA is working!
1️⃣ Download FFmpeg for your OS from:  

- If you do **not** have an NVIDIA GPU, the app will automatically use CPU.

---

## 📝 Whisper Compatibility

- For best compatibility on Windows, use the `openai-whisper` package (not the original `whisper`).
- In your requirements.txt, use:
    ```
    openai-whisper
    ```
- Advanced users can try `whisper-cpp` for faster performance.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- **Virtual Environment**: Do **not** commit your `.venv` folder — it's included in `.gitignore`.
- **File Organization**: 
  - YouTube audio → `audio/`
  - SoundCloud audio → `soundcloud/`
  - Transcripts → `transcripts/`
  - Summaries → `summaries/`
  - Combined transcripts → `combined_transcription/`
- **FFmpeg**: The application will warn you if `ffmpeg` is not found and provide installation instructions.
- **GPU Acceleration**: For faster Whisper transcription, ensure CUDA-enabled PyTorch is installed (see GPU Support section).
- **API Keys**: For OpenAI Cloud, you can either:
  - Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file
  - Enter it when prompted in the application
- **Local LLMs**: For offline AI chat, use Ollama or LM Studio (no API key required).
